# Project4-PDF-Image_Processor

This project is made with the help of Tkinter, PyPDF2, Pillow-PIL, Python(obviously).
This GUI helps a person to extract all the letters or words from the pdf and even lets you save all the images present in it which is quite a handy feature.
If anyone wants to add more features then go ahead. :)
